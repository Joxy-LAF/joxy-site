# Captions for images in the format FILENAME[_LANG] === CAPTION.
#
# This file is searched for a caption top-to-bottom, where just a filename without language tag is
# always used if the filename matches. Therefore, captions with language tag should be added
# above the defaults.
#
# The '===' can be used in a caption, but not in a filename. Captions and filenames are trimmed.
# Newlines in captions are ignored, or actually, all text following the newline is ignored.

# English (default) descriptions
